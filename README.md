Introduction
========
**WhiteRabbit** is a small application that can be used to analyse the structure and contents of a database as preparation for designing an ETL. It comes with **RabbitInAHat**, an application for interactive design of an ETL to the OMOP Common Data Model with the help of the the scan report generated by White Rabbit. 

Features
========
- Can scan databases in SQL Server, Oracle, PostgreSQL, MySQL, MS Access, Amazon RedShift, Google BigQuery, SAS files and CSV files
- The scan report contains information on tables, fields, and frequency distributions of values
- Cutoff on the minimum frequency of values to protect patient privacy
- WhiteRabbit can be run with a graphical user interface or from the command prompt
- Interactive tool (Rabbit in a Hat) for designing the ETL using the scan report as basis
- Rabbit in a Hat generates ETL specification document according to OMOP template

Technology
============
White Rabbit and Rabbit in a Hat are pure Java applications. Both applications use [Apache's POI Java libraries](http://poi.apache.org/) to read and write Word and Excel files. 
White Rabbit uses JDBC to connect to the respective databases.

System Requirements
============
Requires Java 1.8 or higher for running, and read access to the database to be scanned. Java can be downloaded from
<a href="http://www.java.com" target="_blank">http://www.java.com</a>.

Dependencies
============
For the distributable packages, the only requirement is Java 8. For building the package, Java 17+ and Maven are needed.
There are exceptions for databases that use a JDBC driver with a license that does not allow distribution of the driver.
(BigQuery, Teradata)

**BigQuery**

If you want to use a BigQuery instance as the source database, after installing WhiteRabbit, you will need to download
a zip file with the BigQuery JDBC driver, and unzip it in de `repo` directory of the WhiteRabbit installation.
The latest version tested with WhiteRabbit is 1.5.2.1005 .
The zip file can be downloaded [here](https://storage.googleapis.com/simba-bq-release/jdbc/SimbaJDBCDriverforGoogleBigQuery42_1.5.2.1005.zip)

**Teradata**

If you want to use a Teradata instance as the source database, after installing WhiteRabbit, you will need to download
a zip file with the Teradata JDBC driver, and unzip it in de `repo` directory of the WhiteRabbit installation.
The latest version tested with WhiteRabbit is 20.00.00.16 . 
The zip file can be downloaded [here](https://downloads.teradata.com/download/connectivity/jdbc-driver)

Getting Started
===============
WhiteRabbit

1. Under the [Releases](https://github.com/OHDSI/WhiteRabbit/releases) tab, download `WhiteRabbit*.zip`
2. Unzip the download
3. Double-click on `bin/whiteRabbit.bat` on Windows to start White Rabbit, and `bin/whiteRabbit` on macOS and Linux.

(See [the documentation](http://ohdsi.github.io/WhiteRabbit/WhiteRabbit.html#running-from-the-command-line) for details on how to run from the command prompt instead)
